# Movie-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Netflix movie data to uncover key insights such as the most frequent genre, highest-rated and most/least popular movies with their genres, and the year with the most releases. Using Python and Pandas, I performed data cleaning and exploration to help understand content trends and support informed business decisions.
